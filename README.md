# TrumpBot - Reddit Bot

![Trump](Trump.webp)

1. This bot is meant to simulate Donald Trump's grand statements with an added twist of historical speeches. **NB!** I do not support Donald Trump in any shape or form.
2. I like this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r4l12b/comment/hmhk1s0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) because it makes fun of other people's comments and bots - something that Trump is very good at.
3. I think I should get 28/30 points for this project as I did all the FixMe tasks, a proper github repo, 1000 valid comments, and programmed a new post creator (task 4). Here is the output of my bot_counter.py:
```
len(comments)= 1000
len(top_level_comments)= 841
len(replies)= 159
len(valid_top_level_comments)= 831
len(not_self_replies)= 158
len(valid_replies)= 154
========================================
valid_comments= 985
======================================== 
```
For some reason once i hit a 1000 comments, when running the bot, my count of comments and replies went down and now i have less than 1000 valid comments although it should be more. I saw other people having the same problem.
